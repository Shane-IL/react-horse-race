# React JS Horse Race
I just did a react project for a job interview with a live feed updated from a socket.io server and it was quite fun.

To further imporve my skills I'm going to try and make a horse race app.

**Basic spec:**

Clients can connect to a server and be presented with a view of 4 horses on a track. 
The clients can lock in bets and once every client has submitted a bet the server will use an interval generating random numbers
top run a horse race. The horses' progress will update the clients' views.

Once the race is over a result view will be used to inform the client if they won or lost.

**Extras for later:**
* Implement a betting pool for multiple races.
* Have the server run multiple races represented as tracks with set race time and waiting time for bets, let clients pick a track 
and update the view of track status.
*Finally, get the thing online for real.
